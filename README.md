## About The Project

I wanted to create a full stack public library website that I could use as a demo in my portfolio. The website has a responsive design that works great on mobile and in website viewing. My local library is wonderful and I'm an avid reader, both the place and my reading hobby provided inspiration for the website theme idea. I thought it would be a great project that I would really enjoy creating, and I was correct!

I learned a lot while working on this project and also practiced many skills I already had. I hope you enjoy viewing this project as much as I enjoyed creating it. Below you will see several images and descriptions, you can also view the live demo by clicking the link above in the header. 

If you notice any bugs or have an idea to make this website even better please use the links above to make your suggestions! Thank you in advance for viewing my website.
